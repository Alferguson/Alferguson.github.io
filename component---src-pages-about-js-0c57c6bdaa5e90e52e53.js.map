Currently, I am a Software Developer with an emphasis on web\r\n            technologies in San Francisco, just 15 minutes south of where I was\r\n            born.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Growing up, I was fixated on sports, mainly difficult ones like\r\n            wrestling, boxing, and water polo since I thought getting my ass\r\n            handed to me would make me a better individual. Still, I always had\r\n            a soft spot for electronics, mainly trying to get programs to run on\r\n            my pc like random Battlefield and Half Life 2 mods.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            {\" \"}\r\n            While I didn't do much coding when I was younger, I was tinkering\r\n            with different programs to the point where I made a calculator in\r\n            visual basic to prove my friend I could. It wasn't until halfway\r\n            through my nutrition major at UC Berkeley that I truly started to\r\n            code. Judging whether to go down a dietetic route or medical school,\r\n            I worked on an HIV study that gave me first hand exposure to the\r\n            aspects of a clinical study in a hospital environment. There, I\r\n            worked heavily in Excel where I developed marcos to analyze our\r\n            data. Near the end of my 4 years at Berkeley, I was a food science\r\n            intern at eatsa, an automated restaurant startup. My title could be\r\n            argued was a lie though as again, I spent most of my time in Excel\r\n            creating macros and even doing some Java with some colleagues.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            After I graduated Berkeley, I was supposed to go to Montana to\r\n            complete a dietetic internship to become, well, a dietitian. Since I\r\n            now had free time between graduation and going to Montana, I\r\n            pondered why I enjoyed dietetics and realized that I didn't. While\r\n            the science behind nutrition interested me, the application of it\r\n            did not. Working in hospitals is grueling and while I could do it,\r\n            it was not what I wanted. I worked with several patients and doctors\r\n            that changed my outlook of life positively; they taught me life\r\n            skills that I don't think many people come across so I do not regret\r\n            choosing this path initially rather than going for computer science\r\n            straight off the bat. Deciding not to go to Montana did leave me in\r\n            position of uncertainty though.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            I started applying for lab tech roles only to find out that most of\r\n            them expected grave yard shifts and low pay. It wasn't until my Dad\r\n            told me \"Maybe try out that computer thing, seems to be a good\r\n            career and you're always on it anyway\" that I shifted my focus quite\r\n            drastically. He recommended I go to a coding bootcamp hosted by the\r\n            UC Berkeley Extension since it offered a discount for alumni. I\r\n            originally disregarded it since I didn't hold coding bootcamps in\r\n            high esteem. However, this one was different. 1st, it was cheaper,\r\n            2nd, it didn't promise anything; it was tailored towards people who\r\n            were already established in their careers but wanted a switch rather\r\n            than complete newbies to the job market. This way, it felt more\r\n            mature and honest. A few weeks after my Dad suggested it, I applied\r\n            for it and got in. I completed it, acquired a job as a teaching\r\n            assistant, and started my coding journey.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            My primary scripting language is Javascript and I do well with web\r\n            technologies along with Node.js. That said, since I come from a\r\n            bootcamp, I always felt I had to prove myself. Therefore, I try to\r\n            expand into other areas that are more associated with academia. I\r\n            study algorithms and data structures relentlessly, and while my job\r\n            doesn't utilize them, too much, I understand how to apply Big O\r\n            Notation to my code and various advanced coding techniques. When I\r\n            learn, I understand that initially, I may be uncomfortable with it.\r\n            This doesn't push me away, it actually pulls me in. I enjoy learning\r\n            abstract topics like category theory and applying it in a functional\r\n            programming manner. While not everything I learn is applicable to my\r\n            job, it gives me perspective and I can make better decisions because\r\n            of it. Still, at the end of the day, I have a strong sense of what\r\n            needs to be completed and how that is important for not only my team\r\n            and the company, but the end user as well. I enjoy coding both for\r\n            work and in my off time and while I don't contribute to open-source\r\n            as much as I should, I can safely say that my switch to becoming a\r\n            computer programmer is the best one I've ever made.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Otherwise, some of my hobbies include hanging with friends and\r\n            coworkers, calisthenics, watching MMA and boxing, and engrossing\r\n            myself in random mathematic and CS PhD twitter users to see what the\r\n            latest research is saying.\r\n          </p>{\" \"}\r\n          <p>\r\n            Thanks for reading a snippet about my life! In case you think its\r\n            too much, well yeah, its an about me segment and I don't feel like\r\n            writing \"A software engineer who makes great websites\" was good\r\n            enough. If you want that, I would recommend reading my resume since\r\n            that is purposely condensed and here on my portfolio, I try to be\r\n            more personal since I am a personal individual. I value interaction\r\n            and while I do like to work remotely from time to time, I prefer\r\n            being surrounded by people and having comradery as a team.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </section>\r\n      )}\r\n    </TransitionState>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nmodule.exports = {\"aboutSection\":\"about-module--aboutSection--bxbmp\",\"fadeIn\":\"about-module--fadeIn--2BvKN\",\"fadeOut\":\"about-module--fadeOut--2Ps_f\",\"aboutHeader\":\"about-module--aboutHeader--2t5gX\"};"],"sourceRoot":""}
