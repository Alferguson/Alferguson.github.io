// export const aboutMePara = "Hey, I'm a passionate full-stack web developer who absolutely hates bad web design hence why I like making \
// websites because at least I have myself to blame. I mainly work in a React environment utilizing Redux, React-Router, Jest, Webpack, and their respective dev tools. \
// For CSS, I follow the BEM naming scheme to keep styling consistent and for larger projects, I use CSS modules to automate and encasulate the class names. \


// My disgust of websites began at UC Berkeley where even though its home to some of \
// the greatest and brightest minds in Computer Science, it still can't get a simple student sign on page to look nice let alone function well.\
// By the way, I didn't study comp sci but rather Nutrition as I orignally wanted to become a dietitian. Nutrition being basically a \
// pre-med major was difficult and to make matters worse, nutritional websites are notorious for their unintuitive UX. Trying to find \
// research articles deep within the Academy of Nutrition's archives to illustrate a possible benefit for the consumption of Î³-glutamylethylamide \
// was laborious. Still, I credit my ability to read and understand peer-reviewed papers, understanding of statictics, and general knowledge \
// of biochemisty/food-chemistry to my time at UC Berkeley. However, after graduating UC Berkeley, I realized nutrition wasn't my calling in life.";
