      Hi, I'm a fullstack web developer that enjoys being confused by css and javascript! 
      Primary, I work with React and the various tools associated with React such as Redux.
      On one side, I deal with the architecture of websites and how components are used functionally. 
      On the other, I work with css to create some decent animations
      and accessible designs for anyone to enjoy. Mainly I do front-end coding (although I understand how 
      to encorporate server-side code onto the browser with Next.js, Pug, or Handlebar). For back-end, I use Node.js
      with Express for most of my APIs and server-rendering. I have dabbled with Golang and I translate C# apps to Node.js
      a lot too. One of my main goals is to understand WebAssembly since it seems to be a game changer.
      Below is a list of technologies I am proficient in:
