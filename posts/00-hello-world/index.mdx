Welp, that took a _long_ time, creating a portfolio and a blog with it. I hope to showcase my skills as well as my writing progress here.

This blog was inspired and followed by Jason Lengstorf's [course on Gatsby](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/gatsby/). Being able to write blog posts in markdown that
complies to JSX is pretty remarkable. The design of this site is based off of the Zune HD MP3 player (something I still use, even Obama had one!).

If you're reading this, well, cool! Thanks for coming!
